### Usage Instructions:
  To run compile the code that you have written,
  1. ensure that you move the modcc script (.sh / .cmd depending on what operating system you are using)
     to the directory with your source code.
     
  2. On Windows, run ```modcc.cmd sourceFileName DesinationFileName```
     ..* On running this you will get a file with the name "DesinationFileName".
     ..* compile this file using your c compiler
     ..* run the executable
     
  3. For Non-Windows users, I don't have a script as of now, so please contribute !
